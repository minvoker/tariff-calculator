# RealTimeEnergyCostCalculator (Project A - COS40005)

## Stage 1 (Semester 1)

**Understand Energy Supplier Data Handling and Tariff Structures**  
- Research how energy suppliers manage usage data and tariff structures  
- Understand how charges are broken down (e.g. demand charges, network charges, peak/off-peak rates)  
- Analyse what loss factor is and its role in energy cost calculations  

**Algorithm Design and Development**  
- Design and implement an algorithm to process historical energy usage data, while remaining flexible for future real-time adaptation  
- Validate the accuracy of our cost breakdowns based on this historical data  

## Stage 2 (Semester 2)

**Algorithm Improvements and Real-Time Data Integration**  
- Modify the cost calculation algorithm to support real-time data processing  
- Integrate real-time energy data sources (e.g. IoT meters, APIs) into the pipeline  

## Deployment

- Deploy the system  
- Integrate the system into the clientâ€™s data analytics platform while ensuring security considerations
